Traffic Summary Report: 

Total Vehicles: Calculates the total number of vehicles recorded over the specified period.
Vehicle Count Per Day: Provides a daily breakdown of the number of vehicles passing.
Vehicle Type Distribution: Displays the number and percentage of each vehicle type (e.g., cars, buses, bikes).

Peak Traffic Times Report

Hourly Peak Traffic: Identifies the hours with the highest traffic volume.
Daily Peak Traffic: Determines the day with the highest traffic.

Speed Analysis Report

Average Vehicle Speed: Calculates the average speed of all recorded vehicles.
Speed Categorization: Classifies speeds into categories (e.g., slow, medium, fast) and summarizes the results.

How It Works
Input Data: The program reads traffic data from a file (trafficdata.txt)
Input example:
Timestamp; Vehicle Type; Speed (km/h)
2024-08-01 00:00:00; Motorbike; 45
2024-08-01 00:14:23; Bus; 115

Data Processing: Using functions and methods, the program processes the data to analyze trends, calculate statistics, and generate results.
Output Reports: Three comprehensive reports are displayed in the console, detailing traffic trends, peak times, and speed analysis.

Usage Instructions

Prepare the Data File: Ensure trafficdata.txt is available in the program directory with valid traffic data.
